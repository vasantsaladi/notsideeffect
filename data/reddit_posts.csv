229,It was tough
230,It sounds like we have some similarities
231,It night and day from the others
232,It might be the manufacturer of the generic that the pharmacy gave you or it might be that it just doesnâ€™t work for you
233,It messes with how you absorb the medicine.
234,It means it's from epic LLC and they suck
235,It is so relieving to be able to get my work done and actually feel motivated to start/complete tasks
236,"It is hard to find a psychiatrist but if you spend some time looking online and are willing to wait a while, there are psychiatric practices who will see you in person"
237,It is an awful awful brand and it is surprising that this company can continue putting it out on the market without severe consequences
238,It helps a bit for sure but I definitely need more
239,"It doesnâ€™t always happen but I just wanted to give you a heads up.

Aside from that, I wish you well in your journey! I hope you find some clarity and find something that works for you."
240,It did come back a few nights ago

252,Im on 60 mg
253,I'm getting very sleepy these last 3 days

259,If I donâ€™t then Iâ€™m up until 6am
260,If I did then Iâ€™d tell you of course
261,Idk how to fix it

265,I will let you know if anything changes.
266,I will get an hour or two where my body feels relaxed but mentally not much a difference
267,I was started on 20mgs as well but found 5mgs is sweet and subtle just right not off the wall
268,I was so confused when I woke up hours later ðŸ˜© I messaged my Dr when I realized what happened..
269,I was prescribed 20mgs to start to but I tried 10mgs one day on my own and it was much better so now I take 10mgs a day
270,I want my adderrall back! $10 with insurance
271,I vape so I get the nicotine thing
272,I used to get this with â€œoldâ€?adderall
273,I use Walgreens too
274,I understand that bc I had to force myself to only take them on the days I work
275,I thought this was a commonly known fact about taking adderall
276,I think the round ones are not teva
277,I think itâ€™s different for men than for women
278,I take the same amount! I can literally take a nap after taking my meds!
279,I switched form Concerta 54mg to Vyvanse 70mg and now locked in with my Adderall XR 30MG and boy I feel slickâ€?Mc Lovin itâ€?which both of those are equivalent dosages to the Concerta but Adderall XR lasts 12-14 hours with a far more powerful experience than Methylphenidates
280,"I swear it makes me feel like I took molly my jaw start moving weird, Iâ€™ll be sitting down inside and just be dripping sweat, I talk alot, and the shit makes me stuff DONE ðŸ˜­"
281,I suggest calling pharmacies in your area to check for your medication availability
282,"I stopped taking during my pregnancy and for a year after, it went away"
283,"I started off at 10mg 3x a day and felt nothing lol 
Only thing is you might feel ever so slightly clearheaded? Kinda depends on what youâ€™re taking it for"
284,I should have specified
285,I rather take Instant release and able to titrate my dose through out the day.l.
286,I prefer to rise earlier
287,I prefer earlier sleep because Seroquel can be a beast when itâ€™s time to get up
288,I never seen these either but been getting from day 1 lol and wayyyy better than the orange IMO
289,I need to be super sharp 2 a week.
290,I mostly use a small independent pharmacy that always has it in stock
291,"I message my psychiatrist, when that doesnâ€™t work, I call the office and I keep calling until they have my psychiatrist cancel the script and send it to a new one"
292,I live in Texas and have only seen Teva or Aurobindo brands.
293,I know you canâ€™t take them together but how long should I wait back is killing me
294,I just switched to Vyvanse though because I couldnâ€™t take it anymore.
295,I just started taking adderrall yesterday and stayed up late last night having crazy kinky sex- even got out the toys and swing
296,I hope this helps.
297,I hope this helps!
298,I havenâ€™t had any libido since
299,"I have the opposite problem, I donâ€™t eat enough and dread eating"
300,I have my coffee first thing
301,I have IBS and didnâ€™t have this issue ðŸ¤” weird
302,I have heard of people being prescribed 120mg a day but that was years ago think doctors are scared these days since so many people are abusing it and taking advantage of doctors
303,I have called and messaged my provider and she still hasn't called in to the other pharmacies.
304,I have been without meds (XRs) for months and it's really affecting my job
305,I have been taking it for years and my psych has switched up my prescription a few times
306,I have an old prescription for Vyvanse Iâ€™ve been taking from the last shortage
307,I hate IR
308,"I had a similar experience with ER with Concerta prior to switching to adderal IR and then ER.
My Dr asked to try the IR first and to see if we could manage my symptoms but I found the headaches after medication wore off to be unbearable"
309,"I got pregnant while on Adderall but stopped taking it once I knew (after 2 weeks) - mine was a geriatric pregnancy, so I stopped taking EVERYTHING and stopped caffeine as well"
310,I get that much
311,"I get prescribed brand name, but they gave me generic last month."
312,I get Adderrall IR 20mg as a boost since I take 30mg XR in the morning
313,I get 60mg of Adderrall XR daily with two 20 mg Adderrall boosters
314,"I find myself zoning out, not able to listen to verbal instructions/directions, and trying to do other tasks while someone is talking to me"
315,I feel like itâ€™s just diluted and I have less control of how my dosage is
316,I feel like if you donâ€™t need it donâ€™t take it.
317,I feel I identify with the inattentive type the most
318,"I donâ€™t know if you found one yet but try a small, independently owned pharmacy."
319,I donâ€™t know anyone who had any higher and as often as me so I canâ€™t really debate
320,I donâ€™t feel it as intense as IRs even with the doses being the same this could be because of the time release mechanism.
321,I do split my 30mg IRs
322,I didnâ€™t know she did that after afterwards.
323,I didnâ€™t get any headaches
324,I caught a massive stomach bug (I work in a pharmacy...
325,I can respect that.
326,I asked my doctor and he says my dosage is already high
327,I am!
328,I am taking breaks as well to avoid building tolerance
329,I am much happier overall so that imo outweighs my lack of libido
330,"I am in Indiana, this is the 2nd time in 3 months I haven't been able to get my script filled"
331,I am constantly calling around different pharmacies to see what is in stock
332,I am also on the 30 mg dosage
333,I always thought I could never be ADHD because I wasnâ€™t like those kids at all
334,I actually canâ€™t orgasm and get pissed tf off lmao
335,I actually asked him about 90mg a day but he gave told me what your best guess is.
336,Howâ€™s has your experience been with Granules Vs. Teva manufacturers? 
337,"However, Iâ€™ve been married for 12 years so this was much needed!"
338,"However, I know ADHD typically has multiple classifications: inattentive type, hyperactive/impulsive type or a combo"
339,"However, ever since starting the medication again (within the past 1.5 years or so) I feel the new generic and even name brand adderall xr no longer does this to me (and no longer works as well at treating my ADHD, frustratingly).

Can you share with me if you are on Adderall XR, and if so what the dose is and what the typical manufacturer is that is supplying your meds? It should say the manufacturer next to â€œMFGâ€?on your pill bottle - Iâ€™ve been trying to determine which generics work for me and which generics are totally bunk due to the shortage over the past year, but getting the medication has been so damn difficult and the efficacy so inconsistentâ€?thanks!"

I hope you get some help with this - I found it excruciating to be without any meds of any kind (except Tylenol, and then I had a baby with autism and ADHD, so do what you will with that connection).

Definitely consult with your OB/GYN and find out what the current published research says"
